# Traffic-Volume-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Apache-Spark
This project predicts traffic volume using machine learning with Apache Spark. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and time-based analysis on large datasets. Among all models tested, Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) performed best, achieving the lowest error and highest accuracy for short-term forecasting.
